<p>This sample demonstrates how to bind content controls on a Word document to fields in a Microsoft Office Access database. Each content control on the document is bound to a different field in the Northwind sample database. The document also displays an actions
 pane that you can use to navigate through employee records, search for a specific employee record, and save changes that you make in one of the content controls to the database.</p>
