	/// <summary>
	/// This is the package that exposes the Visual Studio services.
	/// In order to expose a service a package must implement the IServiceProvider interface (the one 
	/// defined in the Microsoft.VisualStudio.OLE.Interop.dll interop assembly, not the one defined in the
	/// .NET Framework) and notify the shell that it is exposing the services.
	/// The implementation of the interface can be somewhat difficult and error prone because it is not 
	/// designed for managed clients, but using the Managed Package Framework (MPF) we don’t really need
	/// to write any code: if our package derives from the Package class, then it will get for free the 
	/// implementation of IServiceProvider from the base class.
	/// The notification to the shell about the exported service is done using the IProfferService interface
	/// exposed by the SProfferService service; this service keeps a list of the services exposed globally 
	/// by the loaded packages and allows the shell to find the service even if the service provider that 
	/// exposes it is not inside the currently active chain of providers. If we simply use this service, 
	/// then the service will be available for all the clients when the package is loaded, but the service
	/// will be not usable when the package is not loaded. To avoid this problem and tell the shell that 
	/// it has to make sure that this package is loaded when the service is queried, we have to register 
	/// the service and package inside the services section of the registry. The MPF exposes the 
	/// ProvideServiceAttribute registration attribute to add the information needed inside the registry, 
	/// so that all we have to do is to use it in the definition of the class that implements the package.
