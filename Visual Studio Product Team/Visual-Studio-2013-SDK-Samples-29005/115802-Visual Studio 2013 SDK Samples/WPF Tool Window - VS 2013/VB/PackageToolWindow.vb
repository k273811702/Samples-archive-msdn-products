	''' <summary>
	''' The Package class is responsible for the following:
	'''		- Attributes to enable registration of the components
	'''		- Enable the creation of our tool windows
	'''		- Respond to our commands
	''' 
	''' The following attributes are covered in other samples:
	'''		PackageRegistration:   Reference.Package
	'''		ProvideMenuResource:   Reference.MenuAndCommands
	''' 
	''' Our initialize method defines the command handlers for the commands that
	''' we provide under View|Other Windows to show our tool windows
	''' 
	''' The first new attribute we are using is ProvideToolWindow. That attribute
	''' is used to advertise that our package provides a tool window. In addition
	''' it can specify optional parameters to describe the default start location
	''' of the tool window. For example, the PersistedWindowPane will start tabbed
	''' with Solution Explorer. The default position is only used the very first
	''' time a tool window with a specific Guid is shown for a user. After that,
	''' the position is persisted based on the last known position of the window.
	''' When trying different default start positions, you may find it useful to
	''' delete *.prf from:
	'''		"%USERPROFILE%\Application Data\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0Exp\"
	''' as this is where the positions of the tool windows are persisted.
	''' 
	''' To get the Guid corresponding to the Solution Explorer window, we ran this
	''' sample, made sure the Solution Explorer was visible, selected it in the
	''' Persisted Tool Window and looked at the properties in the Properties
	''' window. You can do the same for any window.
	''' 
	''' The DynamicWindowPane makes use of a different set of optional properties.
	''' First it specifies a default position and size (again note that this only
	''' affects the very first time the window is displayed). Then it specifies the
	''' Transient flag which means it will not be persisted when Visual Studio is
	''' closed and reopened.
	''' 
	''' The second new attribute is ProvideToolWindowVisibility. This attribute
	''' is used to specify that a tool window visibility should be controled
	''' by a UI Context. For a list of predefined UI Context, look in vsshell.idl
	''' and search for "UICONTEXT_". Since we are using the UICONTEXT_SolutionExists,
	''' this means that it is possible to cause the window to be displayed simply by
	''' creating a solution/project.
