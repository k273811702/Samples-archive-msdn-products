	''' <summary>
    ''' The BasicPackage class demonstrates how to create the most basic package in Visual Basic.
	''' Because it is so simple, it doesn't actually do anything and the only way for
	''' it to be loaded is if another package calls IVsShell.LoadPackage().
	''' 
	''' The IVsPackage implementation (in order to be a package a class has to implement
	''' this) is inherited from the Package class. Additionally, inheriting from the 
	''' Package class means that BasicPackage has the PackageRegistration attribute.
	''' 
	''' There are also two attributes that are specified on the BasicPackage class
	''' directly:
	'''		Guid is used as the package Guid. This is used in a number of places
	''' in the registration, the main one being under Package.
	''' 
	''' To register the package (so that Visual Studio knows about it) we use
	''' a tool called RegPkg.exe. That tool looks at the attribute on the classes
	''' implementing IVsPackage to determine what needs to be registered. Once
	''' the package is registered, we call Devenv.exe /rootsuffix Exp /setup.
	''' This is so that Visual Studio can update itself based on the newly
	''' registered (or unregistered) packages. The "/rootsuffix Exp" part lets
	''' Visual Studio know that we want to use the experimental registry hive.
	''' The "/setup" lets Visual Studio know that we are running in the mode where
	''' it is looking for added/removed components to update itself.
