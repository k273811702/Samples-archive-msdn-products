<h1>Microsoft ADO.NET Data Services Application Sample</h1>

<p>
This sample shows a simple ADO.NET Data Service exposing data through the ADO.NET Entity Framework and a WPF application consuming the ADO.NET Data Service.
</p>

<p>
The solution is made up of the following projects:
</P>

<h2>DataServicesWebApp</h2>

<p>
This project contains the Entity Data Model that we will use as the basis of our ADO.NET Data Service, as well as the service itself.
</P>


<h2>UserInterface</h2>

<p>
This project is a user interface implemented in WPF. The entry point for the application is in the code behind file for ProductList.xaml.
