<p>This samples pack contains all the official Windows Driver Kit code examples prepared for use with Microsoft Visual Studio&nbsp;2013 and the Windows Driver Kit (WDK)&nbsp;8.1. The contents of this pack are described
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=309481">here</a>.</p>
<p>The sample pack provides a convenient way to download all the samples at once. These samples are available individually on the Windows Hardware Code Gallery or through Visual Studio&nbsp;2013. The Windows Samples Gallery contains a variety of code samples
 that exercise the various new programming models, platforms, features, and components available in Windows&nbsp;8.1 and/or Windows Server&nbsp;2012&nbsp;R2. These downloadable samples are provided as compressed ZIP files that contain a Visual Studio solution
 (SLN) file for the sample, along with the source files, assets, resources, and metadata necessary to successfully compile and run the sample.</p>
<p>For more information about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in this sample, please refer to the guidance, tutorials, and reference topics provided in the Windows&nbsp;8.1 documentation available in the Windows Developer
 Center. The samples are provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows&nbsp;8.1 and/or Windows Server&nbsp;2012&nbsp;R2.</p>
<p>This pack may be very large and take some time to download.</p>
