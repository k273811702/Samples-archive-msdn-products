## Description

<div id="mainSection">
<p>This sample contains a set of documents that were generated from a variety of sources, including those generated from the Windows Presentation Foundation in the .NET Framework, from Office 2007, and from the Microsoft XPS Document Writer (MXDW). A few of
 the docuemts were either hand-built from scratch or hand-modified from another source. They have been included to provide you with a few documents that exercise a variety of features of the XML Paper Specification.
</p>
<p>In addition, a few high-quality documents have been provided in the Showcase directory to highlight some of the XPS advantages in terms of screen-to-print fidelity. We've also created some documents that are intended to fail, by violating at least one conformance
 rule. These are in the ConformanceViolations directory.</p>
