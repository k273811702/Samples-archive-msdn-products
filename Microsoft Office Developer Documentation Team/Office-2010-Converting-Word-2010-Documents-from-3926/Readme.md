## Description

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Learn how to use the strongly typed classes in the Open XML SDK 2.0 to convert a Word document including VBA code (with a DOCM extension) to a standard document (with a DOCX extension), without loading the document into Microsoft Word. This sample accompanies
 the article <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg131933.aspx">Converting Word 2010 Documents from the DOCM to DOCX File Format by Using the Open XML SDK 2.0</a> in the MSDN Library.</p>
<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
<p>The Open XML file formats make it possible to programmatically modify the structure of Microsoft Word documents, but doing this requires some effort. The Open XML SDK 2.0 adds strongly typed classes that simplify access to the Open XML file formats; the
 SDK simplifies the tasks of modifying the parts of a document. This sample shows how to the use the SDK to do this.</p>
<p>Specifically, the sample includes the VBA code that is required to convert a Word 2007 or Word 2010 document that contains VBA code (and has a DOCM extension) to a standard document (with a DOCX extension).</p>
<p>To use the sample, install the Open XML SDK 2.0. The sample also uses a modified version of code included as part of a set of code examples for the Open XML SDK 2.0. The accompanying article also includes a link to the full set of code examples, although
 you can use this sample without downloading and installing the code examples.</p>
