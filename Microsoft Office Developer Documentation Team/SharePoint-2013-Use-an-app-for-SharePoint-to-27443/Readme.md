## Description

<p>We replaced this sample with a newer sample on GitHub. To use or contribute to the sample on GitHub, see

Provisioning.Pages</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/OfficeDev/PnP/tree/master/Scenarios/Provisioning.Pages">
Provisioning.Pages</a> sample shows how to add wiki pages to a SharePoint site, how to add/remove web parts and HTML content to the created wiki pages. It includes two scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic Wiki page manipulation </li><li>Advanced Wiki page manipulation </li></ul>
<h2>Scenario 1: Basic Wiki page manipulation</h2>
<p>This scenario shows two basic steps: creating a wiki page in a wiki library, using the SitePages library, which is available by default in non-publishing sites (and can easily be adapted to create pages in a custom wiki page library); and filling the empty
 wiki page with HTML content. You can specify your HTML content and then choose <strong>
Run scenario 1</strong> to create the wiki page and add the HTML.</p>
<h2>Scenario 2: Advanced Wiki page manipulation</h2>
<p>This scenario builds on Scenario 1 with more advanced techniques, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a promoted links list. </li><li>Creating Wiki pages using different layouts. </li><li>Adding Web Parts to Wiki pages. </li><li>Adding HTML to a Wiki page cell. </li></ul>
<h2>Scenario cleanup</h2>
<p>If you play around with this sample, you&rsquo;ll create a collection of pages in the sitepages library. You can choose the
<strong>Cleanup created pages</strong> button to remove all these pages. Note that the Promoted Links list that you create will not automatically be deleted.</p>
