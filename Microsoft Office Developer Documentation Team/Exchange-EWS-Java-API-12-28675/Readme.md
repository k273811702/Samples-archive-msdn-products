<h2>Description of the Exchange: EWS Java API 1.2</h2>
<div id="sectionSection0">
<p>EWS provides the functionality to enable client applications to communicate with an Exchange server. The EWS Java API provides a simple API that enables you to use EWS in your Java client applications. This API provides access to much of the same data that
 is made available through Office Outlook. EWS clients can integrate Outlook data into line-of-business (LOB) applications. SOAP provides the messaging framework for messages sent between the client application and the Exchange server. The SOAP messages are
 sent by HTTP.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<div id="sectionSection1">
<p>To use this version of the EWS Java API, you must have the following installed on the computer where you build client applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>JDK 1.6 or later </li><li>Java IDE </li></ul>
<p>If you will be running applications that use the EWS Java API on a different computer, you must have the JDK 1.6 installed on that computer.</p>
<p>The Exchange server on which the Client Access server role is installed must have EWS enabled. If EWS is disabled, the EWS Java API cannot communicate with the server.</p>
