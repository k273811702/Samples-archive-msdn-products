<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
<p>Microsoft Business Connectivity Services (BCS) is provided with Microsoft Office 2010 and SharePoint 2010. Building on the functionality of the Business Data Catalog in Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007, it introduces new features, such as external
 system write-back support and rich client integration. Visual Studio 2010 introduces the Visual Web Part project template. It enables you to use the Visual Web Part Designer to create SharePoint Web Parts and then package and deploy them as part of the build
 process. This sample and the accompanying article demonstrate how to use Visual Studio 2010 to create a Visual Web Part that uses the BCS object model to work with an external content type based on the AdventureWorks Customer entity.</p>
