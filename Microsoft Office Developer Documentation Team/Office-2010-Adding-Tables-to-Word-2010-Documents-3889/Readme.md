## Description

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Learn how to use the strongly typed classes in the Open XML SDK 2.0 to add a simple table to a Word 2007 or Word 2010 document, without loading the document into Microsoft Word. This sample accompanies the article
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg490656.aspx">Adding Tables to Word 2010 Documents by Using the Open XML SDK 2.0</a> in the MSDN Library.</p>
<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
<p>This sample includes the code that is required to insert a table into a Word 2007 or Word 2010 document. To use the sample, you must install the Open XML SDK 2.0. The sample also uses code that is included as part of a set of code examples for the Open XML
 SDK 2.0. The article that accompanies this download also includes a link to the full set of code examples, although you can use the sample without downloading and installing the code examples.</p>
<p>The sample application shows only a few of the available properties provided by the Open XML SDK 2.0 that you can interact with when you create Word tables. For more information, see the documentation that is included with the Open XML SDK 2.0 Productivity
 Tool: Click the <strong>Open XML SDK Documentation</strong> tab in the lower-left corner of the application window, and search for the class that you want to study. Start by examining the
<strong>TableProperties</strong> and <strong>TableCellProperties</strong> classes. Although the documentation does not currently include code examples, given the sample shown here and the documentation, you should be able to successfully modify the sample application.</p>
