<div id="mainBody">
<div class="introduction">
<div>This sample SharePoint-hosted app shows how to add the client-side People Picker control to your app and how to query the picker from other client-side controls. The app lets you enter user names and then calls the picker's
<span><span class="keyword">GetAllUserInfo</span></span> and <span><span class="keyword">GetAllUserKeys</span></span> methods and displays the returned user information on the page.</div>

<h1 class="heading">Description of the client-side People Picker control sample</h1>
<div class="section" id="sectionSection0">
<div>The client-side People Picker control is an HTML and JavaScript control that lets users quickly find and select people, groups, and claims from their organization. The picker is represented by the
<span><span class="keyword">SPClientPeoplePicker</span></span> object, which provides methods that other client-side controls can use to get information or to perform other operations. You can use
<span><span class="keyword">SPClientPeoplePicker</span></span> properties to configure the picker with control-specific settings, such as allowing users to select multiple people or specifying caching options. The picker also uses the web application configuration
 settings that are specified in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.administration.spwebapplication.peoplepickersettings(v=office.15).aspx" target="_blank">
SPWebApplication.PeoplePickerSettings</a> property.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The sample demonstrates how to add the picker to your page markup, and how to initialize it and query it from your script. Rendering, initializing, and other functionality for the picker are handled by the server, including searching and resolving user
 input against the SharePoint authentication providers.</div>

</li><li>
<div>Local administrator permissions on the development computer.</div>
