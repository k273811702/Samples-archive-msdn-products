## Description

<div id="header">The code samples in the Exchange 2013: 101 code samples package show you how to use the Exchange Web Services (EWS) Managed API to perform specific tasks with mailbox data on an on-premises Exchange server, Exchange Online, or Exchange Online
 as part of Office 365. The package spans most Exchange feature areas and each code sample within it shows you how to perform a common Exchange development task, including how to:</div>

<h1 class="heading">Prerequisites</h1>
<div class="section"></div>
<p class="section">The samples require the following:</p>
<div class="section"></div>
<div class="section">
<ul>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li>A target server that is running a version of Exchange starting with Exchange Server 2007 Service Pack 1 (SP1), including Exchange Online.
</li><li>The .NET Framework 4. </li><li>The EWS Managed API assembly file, Microsoft.Exchange.WebServices.dll. You can download the assembly from the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=255472" target="_blank">Microsoft Download Center</a>. The samples assume that the assembly is in the default download directory. You will need to verify the path before you run the solution for an individual
 sample. </li><li>A version of Visual Studio starting with Visual Studio 2010.<br>
Or<br>
A text editor to create and edit source code files and a command prompt window to run a .NET Framework command line compiler.
</li></ul>
<h1>Key components of the sample</h1>
<div class="section"></div>
<p class="section">Each sample typically contains the following files:</p>
<div class="section"></div>
<div class="section">
<ul>
</ul>
</div>
<ul>
<li>*.sln &mdash; A Visual Studio solution file for the project. </li><li>*.csproj &mdash; One or more Visual Studio project files. </li><li>app.config &mdash; The configuration data for the project. </li><li>*.cs &mdash; The using statements, namespace, class, and functions that showcase a specific feature.
</li><li>Authentication.csproj &mdash; The Visual Studio project file for the dependent authentication code.
</li><li>TextFileTraceListener.cs &mdash; The using statements, namespace, class, and code for writing the XML request and response to a text file.
</li><li>Service.cs &mdash; The using statements, namespace, class, and functions that are necessary for acquiring an
<strong>ExchangeService</strong> object that is used in the project. </li><li>CertificateCallback.cs &mdash; The using statements, namespace, class, and code for acquiring an X509 certificate.
</li><li>UserData.cs &mdash; The using statements, namespace, class, and functions for acquiring the user information that is required by the service object.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Security note&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p class="heading">The certificate callback function in the Authentication project is meant for an on-premises test installation of Exchange that uses the default, self-signed certificate. We include this callback function to make it possible to run the Exchange
 101 code samples without having to install a signed certificate. In production, the Exchange server should have a valid, signed certificate. The sample authentication code should not be used on a server that has a signed certificate and it should not be used
 on a production server. To activate the callback method, follow the instructions in the code comments for the Authentication project.&nbsp;<strong><br>
