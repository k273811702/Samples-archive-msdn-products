## Description

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Use the strongly typed classes in the Open XML SDK 2.0 for Microsoft Office to delete comments by all or specific authors in a Microsoft PowerPoint document, without loading the document into PowerPoint. This sample accompanies the article
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg295292.aspx">Deleting Comments by All or a Specific Author in PowerPoint 2010 Documents by Using the Open XML SDK 2.0</a> in the MSDN Library.</p>
<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
<p>The Open XML file formats make it possible to delete comments in Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2007 and Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 documents, but doing so requires some effort. The Open XML SDK 2.0 for Microsoft Office adds strongly typed classes that simplify
 access to the Open XML file formats; the SDK simplifies the tasks of retrieving a list of and deleting comments. This code sample shows how to the use the SDK to accomplish this goal.</p>
<p>To use this sample, you must install the Open XML SDK 2.0. The sample also uses a modified version of code included as part of a set of code snippets for the Open XML SDK 2.0, although you can use the sample without downloading and installing the snippets.</p>
<p>The sample application demonstrates only a handful of the available properties and methods provided by the Open XML SDK 2.0 that you can interact with when modifying a presentation's structure. For more information, see the documentation that comes with
 the Open XML SDK 2.0 Productivity Tool (click the <strong>Open XML SDK Documentation</strong> tab in the lower-left corner of the application window, and search for the class you need to study). Although the documentation does not currently include code examples,
 given the sample shown here and the documentation, you should be able to successfully modify the sample application.</p>
