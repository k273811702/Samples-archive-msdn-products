<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Learn how to use the SharePoint Foundation 2010 managed client object model to work with managed Microsoft Visual C# code within the context of custom Silverlight 4 applications to consume and work with SharePoint list data. This sample accompanies the article
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg512146.aspx">Integrating Custom Silverlight 4 Applications with SharePoint Server 2010</a> in the MSDN Library.</p>
<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
<p>One of the advances made in Microsoft SharePoint Foundation 2010 is the introduction of the SharePoint Foundation 2010 Managed Client Object Model. The managed client object model provides a framework for accessing multiple SharePoint data sources from .NET
 Framework-based managed code and ECMAScript (JavaScript, JScript). Previously you had to use the Server API and test code directly on the server hosting the SharePoint Server installation. The managed client object model enables you to create applications
 that access and work with SharePoint data and perform configuration tasks without writing or installing code directly onto the server computer.</p>
<p>This sample and the accompanying article demonstrate the value of the SharePoint Foundation 2010 managed client object model toward adding significant flexibility and functionality. The managed client object model simplifies consuming SharePoint data and
 working with SharePoint functionality. Combined with the power of Silverlight 4 and its ability to present rich interfaces and dynamic user experiences, there are tremendous possibilities for maximizing the features of SharePoint and Silverlight together.</p>
