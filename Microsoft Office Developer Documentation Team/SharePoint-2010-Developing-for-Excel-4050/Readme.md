## Description

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Learn about the new client services features that are available in Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, including Word Automation Services and Excel Services. This sample accompanies the article

<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
<p>Users are spending more of their time in the Microsoft SharePoint Server environment and with good reason. As the functionality of this environment expands to include features such as rich social networking capabilities, task and calendar management, workflow,
 and forms (both no-code and code), SharePoint Server 2010 becomes more of a destination instead of just a data repository. Of course, SharePoint Server has been an excellent tool to store and manage documents produced by the Microsoft Office client applications.
 SharePoint Server 2010 expands the realm of what users can do with these documents from within the server.</p>
<p>From the perspective of each Office application, Excel Services provides by far the widest and most varied level of functionality through its services offering. You have three object models to choose from when you develop solutions (each of which are addressed
 in this article). In addition, great improvements have been made to the Excel Web Access Web Part, which enables much richer user interaction with an entire workbook or a named object. Finally, you can write custom server-side user-defined functions that can
 be called from a workbook that is hosted on the server.</p>
