## Description

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Learn how to use the strongly typed classes in the Open XML SDK 2.0 to delete comments by all or specific authors in a Word document, without loading the document into Microsoft Word. This sample accompanies the article
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg537288.aspx">Deleting Comments By All Authors or Specific Authors in Word 2010 Documents by Using the Open XML SDK 2.0</a> in the MSDN Library.</p>
<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
<p>The Open XML file formats allow you to delete comments in Microsoft Word documents, but doing this requires some effort. The Open XML SDK 2.0 adds strongly typed classes that grant access to the Open XML file formats. In doing so, the SDK simplifies the
 tasks of retrieving a list of and deleting comments. This code sample shows how to the use the SDK to complete this goal. The sample includes the code that you need to delete comments by one or all authors in a Word 2007 or Word 2010 document.</p>
<p>To use the sample, install the Open XML SDK 2.0. The sample also uses a modified version of code included as part of a set of code examples for the Open XML SDK 2.0. The accompanying article also includes a link to the full set of code examples, although
 you can use the sample without downloading and installing the code examples.</p>
<p>The sample application demonstrates only some the available properties and methods that are provided by the Open XML SDK 2.0 that you can interact with when modifying document structure. For more information, investigate the documentation that is included
 with the Open XML SDK 2.0 Productivity Tool: Click the Open XML SDK Documentation tab in the lower-left corner of the application window, and search for the class that you would like to study. Although the documentation does not currently include code examples,
 given the sample shown here and the documentation, you should be able to successfully modify the sample application.</p>
