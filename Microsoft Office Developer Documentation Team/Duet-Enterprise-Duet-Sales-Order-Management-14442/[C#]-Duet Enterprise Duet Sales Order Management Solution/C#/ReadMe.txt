Duet Enterprise for Microsoft SharePoint and SAP is both a product in itself, jointly developed by SAP and Microsoft to facilitate interoperability between SAP back-end systems and Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010, and a development platform that allows developers to create customized solutions to take advantage of that interoperability.
