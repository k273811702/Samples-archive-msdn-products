## Description

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><span style="font-size:small">The Microsoft Unified Communications Managed API (UCMA) 3.0 Core SDK can be used
<br>
to write interactive voice response (IVR) applications that work with VoiceXML <br>
documents. This set of articles shows how you can use the speech recognition and <br>
speech synthesis features of VoiceXML in a Microsoft Unified Communications <br>
Managed API (UCMA) 3.0 application.</span></p>
<h1><span style="font-size:20px; font-weight:bold">Description</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-size:small">UCMA 3.0 provides two approaches for developing Interactive Voice Response (IVR) applications.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">One approach uses the SpeechRecognitionConnector class to combine the call-control capabilities of UCMA 3.0 with the speech recognition capabilities of the SpeechRecognitionEngine class. The grammars that are used in this approach
 can be either Speech Recognition Grammar Specification (SRGS) XML grammars or grammars that are created by using the GrammarBuilder API. This approach is discussed in Using Speech Recognition in UCMA 3.0 and Lync 2010: Scenario Overview (Part 1 of 5).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">The other approach uses the Browser class to load and interpret a VoiceXML document that can incorporate an SRGS grammar and embedded JavaScript. This approach is the subject of this series of articles.</span></p>
