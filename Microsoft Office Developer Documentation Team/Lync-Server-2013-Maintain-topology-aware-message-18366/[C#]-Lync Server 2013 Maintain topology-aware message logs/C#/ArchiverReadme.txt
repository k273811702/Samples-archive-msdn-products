Sample Description
------------------

 Archiver is sample managed application that demonstrates building
 topology-aware applications.  Each instance of Archiver only logs
 messages not yet stored by an instance on another server; logged
 requests and responses are stamped to notify downstream Archiver
 instances that further logging is unnecessary.

 This sample demonstrates:

 - Topology-aware application design, using message stamping for
   app communication
 - Use of the Stamp message property in C#.
 

 
Running this Sample
-------------------
 
 This sample requires two homeservers and two users, one homed on each 
 homeserver.  Log each user into the server, add each user to the other's 
 contact list, then send IMs in both directions.  Archiver generates an
 Archiver.log file, logging a transcript of SIP traffic generated by the
 users (as well as inter-server NOTIFY and SUBSCRIBE messages.)  Each
 request is only logged once -- on the first server that proxies it.
