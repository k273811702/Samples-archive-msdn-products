<p>This code sample shows you how to upload CSS and site images to the host web and how to set them by using the client-side object model (CSOM).</p>
<p>This sample includes the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embed custom CSS from the app to the host web. In this sample, the location of the page action is changed by means of CSS. This scenario shows you how you can create rendering changes without using a custom master page.
</li><li>Upload assets to the host web, by using the <strong>FileCreationInformation</strong> object. You can upload them to the Site Assets library, or any other location on the host web.
</li><li>Control the properties of the host web. The properties support absolute addresses.
</li><li>Remove the customizations from the host web, by setting the properties to empty strings.
</li></ul>
<p>This sample requires the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2012 or Visual Studio 2013 </li><li>Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio </li><li>A SharePoint 2013 development environment </li></ul>
