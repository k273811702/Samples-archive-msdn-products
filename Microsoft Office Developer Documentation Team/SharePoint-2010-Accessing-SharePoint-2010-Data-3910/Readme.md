## Description

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Learn how to use the Microsoft SharePoint 2010 managed client object model to read and write data in SharePoint sites from Microsoft .NET Framework&ndash;based applications. This sample accompanies the article
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg277498.aspx">Accessing SharePoint 2010 Data with the .NET Client Object Model</a> in the MSDN Library.</p>
<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
<p>With each release of Microsoft SharePoint, developers ask for additional web services to simplify reading and writing SharePoint site data from custom code not on the server that is running SharePoint. Instead of building more and more web services, Microsoft
 introduced in SharePoint 2010 the client object model, which contains a familiar subset of frequently used objects. The client object model is very similar to the SharePoint server object model.</p>
<p>This download shows how to use the .NET client object model to create a Windows Presentation Foundation application that communicates directly with SharePoint. Instead of using the traditional web services approach, the client object model provides a rich,
 SharePoint-specific object model that closely matches the SharePoint 2010 server object model.</p>
<p>In your project, add references to the two required assemblies that compose the .NET client object model. These two assembles (Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.dll and Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime.dll) are located in the ISAPI folder of %ProgramFiles%\Common
 Files\Microsoft Shared\web server extensions\14\.</p>
