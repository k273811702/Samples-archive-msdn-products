## Description

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>Learn how to use the Silverlight client object model in Microsoft SharePoint 2010 to read and write data in SharePoint sites from Microsoft Silverlight applications. This sample accompanies the article
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg595639.aspx">Accessing SharePoint 2010 Data with the Silverlight Client Object Model</a> in the MSDN Library.</p>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>With each release of Microsoft SharePoint, developers ask for additional web services to simplify reading and writing SharePoint site data from custom code that is not on the server that is running SharePoint. Instead of building more and more web services,
 Microsoft introduced in SharePoint 2010 the client object model, which contains a familiar subset of frequently used objects. The client object model is very similar to the SharePoint server-side object model. This sample demonstrates how to use the SharePoint
 2010 Silverlight client object model to create a rich web application that communicates directly with SharePoint. Instead of using the traditional web services approach, the client object model provides a rich, SharePoint-specific object model that closely
 matches the SharePoint 2010 server object model.</p>
