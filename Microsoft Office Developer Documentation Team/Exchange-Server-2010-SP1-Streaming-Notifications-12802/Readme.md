## Description

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><span style="font-size:small">This sample application shows how to connect to your Microsoft Exchange server, create your streaming notification subscription, and then handle any notification events that are returned. To use this code sample, supply the
 Exchange mailbox information and the URL to your server.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">You can use the Microsoft Exchange Web Services (EWS) Managed API to work with events in EWS. Events enable applications to monitor mailbox and public folders for changes. For example, a Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
 application might monitor several mailboxes for new email messages and replicate the contents of those messages to a database. Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 includes two types of notification mechanisms: push notifications and pull notifications. Each of
 these mechanisms has both advantages and limitations. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 Service Pack 1 (SP1) introduces streaming notifications, which combine the power of push and pull notifications.</span></p>
